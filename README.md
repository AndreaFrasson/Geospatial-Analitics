# Project 12: Spatial Fairness in Urban Environments

## Introduction

This project explores the spatial fairness in urban environments, with a specific focus on Louvain's Mobility Hubs deployment. The central question is whether Louvain's Mobility Hubs contribute to or alleviate segregation within the city. The analysis aims to measure the impact of different Mobility Hub configurations on segregation scenarios and average values in the city.

## Research Questions

1. Is Louvainâ€™s Mobility Hubs deployment fair in terms of contributing to or mitigating segregation?
2. How do different deployments of Mobility Hubs affect the segregation scenarios and average values in the city?
3. Is a particular type of deployment preferable over another?
4. Are there general patterns in deployments that lead to higher average segregation levels?
5. Is one measure of segregation more sensitive than another with respect to the other?

## Methodology

The analysis is based on data from the MobiDataLab Codagon or similar datasets. The chosen method involves estimating the average time an individual needs, starting from a Mobility Hub, for:
- Getting out of a neighborhood (choosing a random starting street per simulation).
- Reaching the city center (selecting a random arriving street per simulation).

Different Mobility Hub configurations lead to distinct segregation measure distributions based on these metrics.

## Data Analysis

Utilizing the MobiDataLab Codagon or similar datasets, the analysis will uncover insights into how Mobility Hub deployments impact segregation scenarios. The goal is to identify patterns, preferences, and sensitivities related to different deployment types.

## Discussion

The results will be discussed coherently, addressing the following points:
- Whether Mobility Hubs exacerbate or mitigate segregation in Louvain.
- The preferable types of deployments based on the analysis.
- General patterns contributing to higher average segregation levels.
- Sensitivity analysis to understand which measure of segregation is more influential.

## Conclusion

The project will conclude with a summary of findings and potential implications for urban planning and Mobility Hub deployment strategies in Louvain.
